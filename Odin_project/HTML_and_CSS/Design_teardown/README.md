PROJECT: DESIGN TEARDOWN

In this simple project, you’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine  – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.
